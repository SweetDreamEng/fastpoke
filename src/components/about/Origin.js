                    <p className="med">Fastpoke was designed by a group of young professionals
                        and veteran headhunters in Stamford, CT with a major goal:
                        to help connect professionals with smaller, specialized
                        recruitment firms. The platform was also designed to help
                        talented recruiters market themselves to hiring authorities.
                        With months of brainstorming, hard work, and refining, the
                        platform was launched in August of 2020.
