                    <p>Hiring authorities can share an opening
                        with you personally by sending one to
                        your inbox. A requisition may only be sent
                        to 3 recruiters maximum for contingency
                        placements so you won't have to worry
                        about cutthroat competition. Relationships
                        and collaboration is what we're all about.
